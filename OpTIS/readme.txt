Usage: Run this script to cross reference MRV and OpTIS tillage and cover cropping claims. 

Notes: 

Manual Adjustments to Script Output: 
- For General Mills fields with “Other” as crop – manually filled in 
Kernza for Funk and Cover Crop Mix: Clover, Radish, Triticale, Turnip for Matt’s (Study)
- Corteva-Nutrien. A field was found and added to the sheet with CC practice change but no CC event found in enrollment year. 
1adad386-f272-4521-b6e9-ac2af3ab283d (Sutter field 1). The script currently checks to make sure cover cropping was not done in the past 
(in the case of cover crop practice change eligibility). An update can be made to also verify that the producer actually cover cropped
 in the enrollment year. 

Questions
Are there regions and or production systems where OpTIS is more reliable?
